This is an updated (and slightly harder) version of my previous Hangman Lite, utilizing the random_word module.
Players select the number of attempts needed, as well as the minimum length of the secret word.
The game ends if either the player successfully guesses the secret word in the allotted number of attempts...
or not.

Enjoy!
